    "### Data Trends: There does not seem to be a positive relationship between a school's spending per student and its student's performance. It appears that the relationship between School's Spending Range per Student is negative. The schools that have the highest performance spend less per student.\n",
    "### Data Trends: The data indicates that the students of the charter schools have more suspense than their counterparts at district schools. 8 of 10 top performing schools are charter schools. There is a large gap in the overall passing rate between students at charter schools and those in district schools.\n"
